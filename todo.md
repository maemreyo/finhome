- **Investment analysis**: ROI calculations, rental income projections
- **Timeline visualization**: Interactive financial timeline with scenarios
- **Market data integration**: Vietnamese bank rates, property market data

### ‚ùå What's Missing for Basic MVP

#### 1. **Critical Missing Components (25% of MVP)**

**A. Financial Plan Management Pages**
- ‚ùå **Plan list/overview page** - Users can't view all their plans
- ‚ùå **Plan detail/edit page** - Users can't modify existing plans
- ‚ùå **Plan comparison tool** - Can't compare different scenarios

**B. Property Search & Management**
- ‚ùå **Property search interface** - Core feature for finding properties
- ‚ùå **Property detail pages** - Can't view property information
- ‚ùå **Property favorites** - Can't save interesting properties

**C. Bank Rate Comparison**
- ‚ùå **Bank comparison tool** - Can't compare interest rates
- ‚ùå **Rate tracking** - No historical rate data visualization
- ‚ùå **Loan recommendation engine** - Missing smart recommendations

**D. User Onboarding & Help**
- ‚ùå **User onboarding flow** - New users lack guidance
- ‚ùå **Tutorial system** - No contextual help or walkthroughs
- ‚ùå **Help documentation** - Missing user guides

#### 2. **Data Integration Issues (Critical)**
- ‚ùå **Real property data** - No actual property listings
- ‚ùå **Live bank rates** - Using mock data instead of real rates
- ‚ùå **Market data feeds** - No real-time market information

### üîß Next Logical Implementation Steps

#### **Phase 1: Complete Core MVP (Weeks 1-2)**
1. **Create Plan Management System**
   - Build `/plans` list page with filtering, sorting
   - Create `/plans/[id]` detail page with edit capability
   - Add plan comparison functionality

2. **Implement Property Search**
   - Build `/properties` search interface
   - Create `/properties/[id]` detail pages
   - Add property favorites system

3. **Add Bank Rate Comparison**
   - Build `/banks` comparison tool
   - Create rate tracking dashboard
   - Add loan recommendation logic

#### **Phase 2: User Experience (Weeks 3-4)**
1. **User Onboarding System**
   - Create welcome flow for new users
   - Add contextual help system
   - Build tutorial walkthrough

2. **Data Integration**
   - Integrate real property data sources
   - Connect to Vietnamese bank APIs
   - Add market data feeds

### üö® Critical Issues & Gaps

#### **1. Route Duplication Problem**
- **Issue**: Duplicate route files (`/dashboard/*` and `/[locale]/dashboard/*`)
- **Impact**: Maintenance burden, potential routing conflicts
- **Priority**: High - needs immediate consolidation

#### **2. Missing Core User Flows**
- **Issue**: Users can create plans but can't manage them effectively
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, low retention
- **Priority**: Critical - blocks MVP launch

#### **3. Data Source Dependencies**
- **Issue**: Most features use mock data
- **Impact**: Product not ready for real users
- **Priority**: High - needed for production launch

### üìä MVP Completeness Score

| Component | Status | Completeness |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Database Schema | ‚úÖ Complete | 95% |
| Authentication | ‚úÖ Complete | 100% |
| UI Components | ‚úÖ Complete | 85% |
| Financial Planning | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | 75% |
| Property Management | ‚ùå Missing | 25% |
| Bank Comparison | ‚ùå Missing | 20% |
| User Onboarding | ‚ùå Missing | 10% |
| Data Integration | ‚ùå Missing | 15% |

**Overall MVP Readiness: 60%**

### üéØ Recommended Next Action

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Complete Plan Management System**
- This is the core user journey that's partially implemented
- Users can create plans but can't manage them effectively
- Building the plan list and detail pages will immediately improve user experience
- Estimated time: 3-5 days

**REASON**: The infrastructure is solid, but the user-facing features are incomplete. Focus on completing the core financial planning flow before adding new features.
