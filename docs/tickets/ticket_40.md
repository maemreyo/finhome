# Ticket 40: Gemini API Key Management UI

## Overview
Create a comprehensive user interface for managing multiple Gemini API keys to support production-level key rotation and rate limiting. This will ensure robust AI functionality with automatic failover when rate limits are encountered.

## Problem Statement
Currently, Gemini API keys are managed only through environment variables, which makes it difficult to:
- Monitor key usage and status in production
- Add/remove keys dynamically without server restart
- View rate limiting statistics and key health
- Troubleshoot API key issues in real-time

## Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Key Management Interface**
   - Add/remove API keys securely
   - View key status (active/inactive/rate-limited)
   - Test key validity
   - Set key priorities/weights

2. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Real-time usage statistics per key
   - Rate limiting status and cooldown timers
   - Request success/failure rates
   - Historical usage patterns

3. **Security Features**
   - Encrypted key storage in database
   - Role-based access control (admin only)
   - Key masking in UI (show only last 4 characters)
   - Audit logging for key operations

### Technical Implementation
1. **Database Schema**
   - `gemini_api_keys` table with encrypted storage
   - Usage tracking and statistics tables
   - Audit log table

2. **API Routes**
   - `/api/admin/gemini-keys` - CRUD operations
   - `/api/admin/gemini-keys/status` - Real-time status
   - `/api/admin/gemini-keys/test` - Key validation

3. **UI Components**
   - Admin settings page integration
   - Key management modal/page
   - Status dashboard with charts
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket/polling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Admin can add new Gemini API keys through UI
- [x] Admin can view all keys with masked values and status
- [x] Admin can remove or disable keys
- [x] Real-time monitoring of key usage and rate limits
- [x] Keys are securely encrypted in database
- [x] Integration with existing GeminiKeyManager
- [x] Proper error handling and validation
- [x] Mobile-responsive design
- [x] Role-based access control

## Priority: High
This is critical for production deployment of AI features with reliable rate limiting.

## Estimated Effort: 2-3 days

## Dependencies
- Existing GeminiKeyManager implementation
- Database encryption utilities
- Admin authentication system

## Success Metrics
- Zero downtime due to rate limiting in production
- Easy key management without server restarts
- Clear visibility into API usage patterns
- Secure key storage and access control
