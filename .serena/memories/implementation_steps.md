# Implementation Steps

1. Create lib/gemini-key-manager.js - Reusable key rotation system
2. Update API route to use key manager
3. Add intelligent rate limiting middleware
4. Update test script to handle retries better
5. Add configuration for multiple keys
6. Implement request queuing system

## Additional Rate Limiting Strategies
- Dynamic delays based on response headers
- Request batching for similar inputs
- Caching of repeated requests
- Progressive backoff on failures
- Load balancing across keys
